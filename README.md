# Internet 8 – SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)

## Problem Statement

Rapid digitalisation has shifted essential services such as banking, shopping, and government services to online platforms. 

Elderly individuals, especially people with low income, limited education, or physical limitations that often struggle to use the internet safely. 

The digital gap increases inequality and exposes them to scams, fraud, and misinformation.
